# Pathplanning-V-REP
Warehouse with 2 mobile robots in V-REP. LUA.

In order to run simulation you need to create .txt file with names of dummies you want each robot to move to and end it with "Goal1", eg: 
"StorageA1
StorageB3
Goal1"

Than you need to update location of the file line 118. Do it in both scripts for Transporter1 i Transporter2 robots.
